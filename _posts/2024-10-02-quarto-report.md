## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Dynamic Reporting techniques through the integration of R and Python, utilizing Inline Code Dynamic Reporting. By combining these powerful programming languages, we create comprehensive, flexible, and interactive reports that adapt to data changes seamlessly.

## Business Question
How can we analyze and visualize sales performance metrics dynamically from 2022 to 2024, focusing on aspects like total orders, gross sales, discounts, returns, net sales, shipping costs, and total sales?

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the datasets used for analysis.
- **scripts**: Includes R and Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
- **reports**: Dynamic reports generated using Quarto.
- **figures**: Stores the visualizations produced.

## Column Descriptions
- **Total Orders**: Number of transactions in a month.
- **Gross Sales**: Total revenue before deductions.
- **Discounts**: Price reductions offered to customers.
- **Returns**: Value of returned products.
- **Net Sales**: Actual revenue generated after deductions.
- **Shipping Costs**: Expenses related to product delivery.
- **Total Sales**: Final revenue after accounting for shipping costs.

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning using Python and R.
2. Analysis of sales metrics through interactive visualizations.
3. Dynamic reporting using R Quarto and Python to present findings.

## Exploring the Data
The data encompasses key performance indicators that allow us to understand sales trends and patterns over the specified period. By utilizing Inline Code Dynamic Reporting, users can modify analysis parameters in real time.

## Analyzing Trends
Trends in customer behavior, discounts, returns, and shipping costs are monitored to inform business strategies and improve profitability. This analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of how various factors affect net sales.

## Visualizations
Visual representations of sales data are created using R and Python libraries, showcasing key metrics over time. These visualizations are dynamically linked to the underlying data, allowing for real-time updates.

## Reporting/Conclusion
Dynamic reporting enables the generation of reports that automatically update with new data, ensuring that insights remain relevant and actionable. The integration of R and Python supports flexible and powerful data analysis, offering enhanced decision-making capabilities.

## Dataset Source
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at [Online Business Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylermorse/retail-business-sales-20172019)
The report for this project is available here [Comprehensive Analysis of Annual Sales Performance](https://rpubs.com/senddimas/1227271)


## Inline Code Dynamic Reporting
Inline Code Dynamic Reporting is a method where programming code is embedded within the report to dynamically process, analyze, and display data. This approach allows users to adjust code within the report to tailor outputs, such as calculating new metrics or creating custom visualizations. 

### Benefits of Inline Code Dynamic Reporting:
- **Flexibility**: Users can create fully customizable reports that adapt to changing analysis needs.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for manual report generation or modifications, as changes can be made directly within the report.
- **Interactivity**: Users can interact deeply with data by modifying code to see how different scenarios affect report outcomes.

### Integration of R Quarto & Python
By leveraging both R and Python, we can create a robust dynamic reporting environment. R's Quarto format allows for seamless integration with Python, enabling users to utilize the strengths of both languages in one comprehensive reporting framework.
