# Startup Profit Prediction

![starup3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c3570f3-eaa7-46c7-b17b-e2940352f3cd)


## Overview
This project aims to predict the profit of startups based on their spending in Research and Development (R&D), Administration, and Marketing, as well as their location. Using a linear regression model, we will analyze the relationships between these variables and the startups' profit.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Contains the results and plots generated from the analysis.

## Column Descriptions
| Variable Name         | Role     | Type       | Demographic | Description                    |
|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| R&D Spend             | Feature  | dbl        |             | Total Research Spending        |
| Administration        | Feature  | dbl        |             | Total Administrative Spending  |
| Marketing Spend       | Feature  | dbl        |             | Total Marketing Spending       |
| State                 | Feature  | Character  | State       | Regional data                  |
| Profit                | Feature  | dbl        |             | Total Profit                   |

## How to Use This Data
To use this data, follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset from the provided source.
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and build the prediction model.
4. Run the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Exploring the Data
The dataset provides information on 50 startups, including their spending on R&D, Administration, and Marketing, as well as their profit and location. Initial exploration involves understanding the distribution of these variables and checking for any missing values or outliers.

## Analyzing Trends
We will analyze trends to see how spending in different areas affects the profit of the startups. This involves:
- Examining the correlation between R&D, Administration, and Marketing spend with profit.
- Investigating if the location (state) of the startup has any significant impact on profit.

## Visualizations
Visualizations will be used to illustrate the relationships and trends in the data. Some of the visualizations include:
- Scatter plots to show the relationship between spending and profit.
- Box plots to compare profit across different states.
- Correlation heatmaps to understand the strength of relationships between variables.

## Reporting
The results and findings from the data analysis and model predictions will be documented and reported. This includes:
- Summary of the data exploration.
- Insights from the trend analysis.
- Performance metrics of the linear regression model.
- Recommendations based on the findings.
